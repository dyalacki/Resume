# Resume
This repository will be for a resume I wrote in LaTex that could serve as a template for others
In the PDF titled "yalacki_cv.pdf" you will see the layout of the PDF as it is now. 
LaTex likes to streamline all the text, so in order to use the entire page, have columns, pictures, lines, etc, I had to use textblocks. On the one had this is a terrible approach becuase you have to re-adjust the positioning if the content changes. On the other hand, the code is modular so that if you remove a textblock, everything else is still there. 

For the example, you have to install the open source font mundo sans std (otf) and the microsoft font verdana. I am currently trying to find an open source replacement for verdana that achieves the same aesthetic.
